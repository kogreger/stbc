# Spatio-Temporal Betweenness Centrality Measure
At the [AAG 2015 Conference](http://www.aag.org/cs/annualmeeting "AAG 2015 Conference") I introduced the Spatio-Temporal Betweenness Centrality Measure I developed in the course of my PhD thesis. This repository contains both the slides I presented and the corresponding code.
